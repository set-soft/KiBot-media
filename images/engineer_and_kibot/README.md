Final prompt: (prompt magic)
```
A bespectacled electronics engineer in a crisp white lab coat and sleeves rolled
up on their forearms, holds a steaming cup of coffee with both hands, gazing
intently over the rim at a tiny, endearing robot with a metallic body and glowing
blue circuits, busily repairing a complex circuit board with a precise soldering
iron, the robot's chest proudly displaying the legend "KiBot" in bold, metallic
letters. The engineer's facial expression is one of concentrated concern, while
the robot focuses intently on its intricate task, surrounded by scattered microchips,
wires, and tiny tools in a cluttered but dimly lit workbench, capturing the intense
atmosphere of a late-night repair session. With the style of Ash Thorp, Simon Stalenhag,
and Loish, combining photorealistic details with a cinematic, atmospheric, and moody
lighting, evoking a sense of hyperrealism and sharp focus, reminiscent of a high-end,
64 megapixel advertisement, perfectly composed to draw attention to the finely
detailed robot and the engineer's captivated expression.
