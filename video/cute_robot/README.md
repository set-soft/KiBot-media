### 01-realistic_close_up.mp4

Prompt
```
Telephoto close up: cute robot
```

Seed:  2636239344

Aspect ratio: Landscape (5:3)

Resolution: 720p (1280x768)

Here the robot turns and looks at the Ki logo. The result is good


### 02-realistic_orbit.mp4

Prompt
```

In the style of cinematic
```

Seed: 311863307

Aspect ratio: Landscape (5:3)

Resolution: 720p (1280x768)

Here the robot just moves at its place, lamentably one of the hands overlaps the Ki logo, making it invalid.
