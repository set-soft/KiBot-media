[Music]

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,480
In the realm where circuits dance,

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,759
With KiCad's grace, we take a chance.

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,439
Through tangled wires and schematics bright,

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,880
A world of dreams ignites the night.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,480
O KiBot, guardian of the code,

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,840
With every task, our burdens unload.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,360
In silence you weave, the files we require,

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,879
A symphony of circuits, you inspire!

10
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,440
No more chaos, no more despair,

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,120
With every commit, you're always there.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Reproducible paths, so clear and precise,

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,880
In Docker's embrace, we find paradise.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,399
O KiBot, guardian of the code,

15
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,840
With every task, our burdens unload.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,320
In silence you weave, the files we require,

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,880
A symphony of circuits, you inspire!

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,400
No more chaos, no more despair,

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,439
With every commit, you're always there.

20
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:24,119
Reproducible paths, so clear and precise,

21
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,149
In Docker's embrace, we find paradise.

22
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:31,439
O KiBot, guardian of the code,

23
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,840
With every task, our burdens unload.

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,399
In silence you weave, the files we require,

25
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:59,920
A symphony of circuits, you inspire!

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,159
From GitHub to GitLab, our voices unite,

27
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,560
In harmony forged, we conquer the night.

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,160
Errors erased, our visions align,

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,879
With KiBot beside us, our futures will shine.

30
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,120
O KiBot, forever we'll sing,

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,840
Of the freedom and joy that you bring.

32
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,319
In the world of design, your legacy grows,

33
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:34,480
A master of rhythm, where innovation flows!

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:48,880
