1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Okay, so today we're diving 
into this really cool tool I found.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,920
It's called KiBot.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,920
KiBot? Yeah,

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,360
And it's designed to work with KiCad.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,160
I'm sure a lot of our listeners have 
heard of it, maybe even use it.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,720
It's that free and open source 
electronics design software.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,040
Yeah, it's getting pretty popular.

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,200
A lot of people use it.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,440
Yeah, exactly.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,080
So if anyone out there listening is tired 
of those tedious tasks, you know,

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,760
like all the boring stuff you have to 
do when you're designing electronics.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,520
Oh, tell me about it.

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,800
So much clicking

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,119
Right, that's what KiBot is supposed 
to be like, your new best friend.

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,600
Yeah, it can really be a game changer, 
especially if you're doing any kind

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,280
of serious design work.

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,040
Okay, so walk me through 
it from the beginning.

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,599
What kinds of tasks 
does KiBot automate?

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,360
Well, the main thing is it handles all 
those essential manufacturing files.

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,880
Like Gerber files.

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,960
Okay, Gerber files.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,080
Yeah, but for people who don't know, 
what are those?

23
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,040
So Gerber files are basically like, 
think of them as blueprints,

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,160
but for your circuit board, 
you send those to the manufacturer,

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,720
and that's what they use to actually 
print the circuit board.

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,319
So instead of me having to go and figure 
out all the settings every single

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,040
time, KiBot takes care of all that.

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,360
Exactly. It's a huge time saver.

29
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,320
And honestly, it just kind of takes 
away that possibility for human error.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,360
Because we all know you stare at 
those circuit boards long enough, you're

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,840
bound to mess something up, 
right?

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,560
Oh, yeah, for sure.
Been there, done that.

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,560
Not fun.

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,039
So it's definitely saving us from some 
late night manufacturing panic attacks.

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,200
For sure.

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,120
Okay, so that's one less 
thing to worry about.

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,960
But what about catching those errors 
before we even get to that stage?

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,160
Like during the actual design process?

39
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,920
Right, and that's where those design rule
checks come in, the ERC and DRC.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
It's like having someone looking over 
your shoulder, double checking your work.

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,680
Pretty much.

42
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,880
It goes through and looks for common errors, 
any kind of violations,

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,720
and it really just makes sure 
your design is, you know,

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,680
solid and actually manufacturable.

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,880
That's a relief

46
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,520
Sometimes my brain just can't 
even handle another schematic.

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,000
I feel that it's a lot, especially when 
you're in the zone for hours.

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,240
Okay, so we've covered the manufacturing 
files and the error checking.

49
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,800
What else can this thing do?

50
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,560
Well, it can do documentation, too.

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,800
Documentation, really?

52
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Yeah, like your bills of materials.

53
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,559
You know, those lists of every 
component you need?

54
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,640
KiBot generates those for you.

55
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,360
Oh, wow.

56
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,800
Yeah. It even gives you cost estimation, 
so you're not stuck trying to

57
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,680
wrangle a spreadsheet at 
two in the morning.

58
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,040
Okay. So it's like it's helping 
with the budget too.

59
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,000
That's actually amazing.

60
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,600
Exactly. It's super helpful whether 
you're just doing this as a hobby or

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,760
you're running a whole business.

62
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,080
Right. That makes sense.

63
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,280
Wow. Okay, so far, KiBot is 
blowing my mind a little bit.

64
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,000
Wait, there's more.

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,120
Oh, there's more? 
Yeah.

66
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,240
We haven't even gotten to one 
of the coolest parts yet.

67
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,320
KiBot also does 3D modeling.

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,200
3D modeling?

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,560
Yeah, like, really high quality 3D 
models of your boards using Blender

70
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,280
Okay, now that I'm really interested in.

71
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,120
Okay, so before the break, you 
kind of blew my mind a little bit.

72
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,680
Talking about 3D modeling, 
I'm really curious about this.

73
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,120
Yeah, it's seriously cool stuff.

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,959
So tell me, how does it actually work?

75
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,440
Well, KiBot basically takes your

76
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,920
KiCAD designs, right?
And then it transforms them into these,

77
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,280
like, really detailed 3D models.

78
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,280
Okay, so we're not talking about 
just like, a basic 3D block here.

79
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,440
No, no, no, not at all.

80
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Like, it shows you the components, 
the placements, you know, all the

81
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,560
details, even down to, like, 
the surface finishes.

82
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
It's pretty impressive.

83
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
Wow, that's amazing.

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,920
What are the advantages of having, 
like, a super high quality 3D model like that?

85
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,160
Well, first off, just visualizing the design.

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,520
You're not stuck with these, like, 
flat schematics anymore.

87
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,840
You can actually see how it all 
fits together in 3D space.

88
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,120
Right. That makes a lot of sense.

89
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,040
Yeah, it makes it way easier to spot 
any potential issues, like, you know,

90
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,200
something's too close together or just.

91
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,880
Just to get a feel for the layout, 
you know?

92
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,160
Right. Especially with more complex 
boards, that could be really helpful.

93
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,440
Totally. And it's not just for 
the designer either.

94
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,040
You can use these 3D models for 
presentations,

95
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,760
marketing materials, stuff like that.

96
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,760
Yeah, definitely.

97
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
I mean, everyone loves 
a good 3D render.

98
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,480
It's way more exciting than just 
looking at, like, a 2D drawing.

99
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,280
Oh, for sure.

100
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,160
And what's cool is because it uses 
Blender, which is like a really powerful

101
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,680
3D modeling software.

102
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,400
You're not just limited to viewing it.

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,040
You can actually export it in different 
formats and use it with other tools.

104
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,560
Oh, okay.

105
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,120
So you could take the model 
from KiBot

106
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,840
and use it in a completely 
different program.

107
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,440
Exactly.

108
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,680
So, like, give me an example.

109
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,440
How would you use that?

110
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,120
Well, let's say you're working with, like,

111
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,240
mechanical engineers and they're 
designing the enclosure for your board.

112
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,960
You can export the KiBot model and 
send it to them and they can actually

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,800
use it in their CAD software.

114
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,360
Oh, so they can make sure it fits properly 
and everything?

115
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,240
Yep, exactly. No more back and forth trying 
to describe everything over email.

116
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,600
That's huge, because those design 
clashes can be a real pain.

117
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,280
For sure.

118
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,600
Or even if you just want to run 
some simulations, see how your 
board's going

119
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,120
to perform under different conditions, 
you can use those models for that too.

120
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,760
Wow, it's like you're giving your design
a virtual test run before you

121
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,840
even solder anything.

122
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,400
Exactly. And this kind of 3D integration, 
it's not something you see in a

123
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,040
lot of free and open source tools.

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,440
It's really pretty remarkable what 
they're doing with KiBot.

125
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,800
It's very, very cool.

126
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Okay, so we talked about the 3D modeling, 
but there's one more thing that I

127
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,840
really wanted to ask you about, 
and that's the product variants.

128
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,520
I've definitely worked on projects where like,
 we needed a few different

129
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,080
versions of the same board, and it's 
always a bit of a headache to manage.

130
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,480
So before the break we were talking 
about product variants, and I gotta say,

131
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,600
for someone like me who hates juggling 
a million different files, this

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,920
sounds like a dream come true.

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,360
Oh yeah, it's a lifesaver.

134
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,400
So how does KiBot make it so easy 
to handle all these different variations?

135
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,920
So imagine this, you have your base 
circuit board design, right?

136
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,280
But you need a few different versions, 
just with little tweaks here and there

137
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,240
Right, like maybe one needs a different 
connector or are you swapping

138
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,679
out a wireless module or something?

139
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,720
Exactly. And instead of having to create like 
separate files for each version, KiBot

140
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,800
lets you manage all those variations 
within the same project.

141
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,040
Oh wow, so it's all in one place.

142
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,520
Yep. You basically set up parameters, 
right, and different options for things. 

143
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,000
So for your wireless module, let's say 
it comes in Bluetooth, WiFi and cellular.

144
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,880
You tell KiBot, hey, this component 
could be any of these.

145
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,960
It's kind of like having a dropdown menu
right there in your design

146
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,440
So you don't have to go back and like manually 
swap out components every time you

147
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,360
need a different version.

148
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Yeah. New.

149
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,520
When you're ready to generate your 
output files, you just choose which

150
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,080
variant you want, KiBot does the rest.

151
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,600
That is so much slicker than 
the way I've been doing it.

152
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,120
And what about the documentation, 
does it handle that for each variant too?

153
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,280
Absolutely. You get the correct BoM, 
assembly drawings, everything for

154
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,800
whichever variation you choose.

155
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,880
So no more second guessing if you're 
looking at the right files.

156
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,200
Okay, seriously, that's amazing.

157
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,400
Especially for, like, bigger projects 
that could save so much time and

158
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,920
confusion. It's like KiBot just brings 
order to the chaos.

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,320
Exactly. And this isn't just for, like, 
small tweaks.

160
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,320
We're talking.

161
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,600
You can even create completely
 different products from that same core design

162
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,240
Oh, wow. So you could have one
 base design that's like

163
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,120
a platform for a whole product line.

164
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,040
Exactly.

165
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,240
Think of the design, reuse the time 
and money you save.

166
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,920
KiBot really bringing these high end
features to everyone, which is incredible.

167
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,840
It's amazing how much you could 
do with this one tool, honestly,

168
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,800
we've covered so much automating, 
all those tedious tasks, creating amazing

169
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,920
3D models, and now managing all 
these product variants.

170
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,160
KiBot sounds like it has everything covered.

171
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,280
Yeah, it's really remarkable what they've 
managed to put together.

172
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,760
The coolest part is it's open source,
right?

173
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,400
So it's constantly evolving, 
always getting better.

174
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,439
Exactly. There's a whole community of 
developers constantly adding new

175
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,000
features and making it even better.

176
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,680
That's what I love about open source.

177
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,080
So, any predictions for the future of KiBot?
 Where do you see it going?

178
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,760
Well, it's hard to say for sure, but I think 
it's part of this larger trend.

179
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,240
You know, these really powerful design
tools are becoming accessible to

180
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,280
everyone. So as it evolves, I think 
KiBot has the potential to, you know,

181
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,600
just make advanced electronics design 
something anyone can do, not just big

182
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,960
companies with big budgets.

183
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,120
That is such an exciting thought.

184
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,120
Who knows what incredible inventions 
people will come up with when they have

185
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,280
these kinds of tools at their fingertips? 
Well, I have to say, this deep

186
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,320
dive into KiBot has been really eye opening.

187
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,760
I think it's an amazing resource for anyone.

188
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,160
Whether you're just getting started with 
electronics or you're a seasoned pro.

189
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:27,960
I totally agree.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,520
It's definitely worth checking out.
