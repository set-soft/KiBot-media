1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,040
okay so today we're diving into this really cool 
tool I found it's called KiBot KiBot yeah and it's  

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,600
designed to work with KiCad I'm sure a lot of our 
listeners have heard of it maybe even use it it's  

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,360
that free and open- source Electronics design 
software yeah it's getting pretty popular a lot  

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,840
of people use it yeah exactly so if anyone out 
there listening is tired of those tedious tasks  

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,920
you know like all the boring stuff you have to 
do when you're designing Electronics oh tell me  

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,440
about it so much clicking right that's what bot is 
supposed to be like your new best friend yeah it  

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,800
can really be a game changer especially if you're 
doing like any kind of serious design work okay so  

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,400
walk me through it from the beginning what kinds 
of tasks does KiBot automate well the main thing  

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,440
is it handles all those essential manufacturing 
files like Gerber files okay Gerber files yeah  

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,320
but for people who don't know what are those so 
Gerber files are basically like think of them as  

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,360
blueprints but for your circuit board you send 
those to the manufacturer and that's what they  

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,800
use to actually you know print the circuit 
board so instead of like me having to go and  

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,000
like figure out all the settings every single 
time KiBot takes care of all that exactly it's  

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,760
a huge time-saver and honestly it just kind 
of takes away that like possibility for human  

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,320
error CU we all know you stare at those circuit 
borns long enough you're bound to mess something  

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,400
up right oh yeah for sure been there done that 
not fun so it's definitely saving us from some  

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,520
late night manufacturing panic attacks for sure 
okay so that's one last thing to worry about but  

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,440
what about catching those errors before we even 
get to that stage like during the actual design  

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,520
process right and that's where those design rule 
checks come in the ERC and DRC it's like having  

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,840
someone looking over your shoulder double-checking 
your work pretty much it goes through and looks  

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,000
for common errors any kind of violations and 
it really just makes sure your design is you  

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,320
know solid and actually manufacturable that's a 
relief yeah sometimes my brain just can't even  

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,760
handle another schematic I feel that it's a lot 
especially when you're in the zone for hours okay  

24
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,040
so we've covered the manufacturing files and the 
error checking what else can this thing do well  

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,360
it can do documentation too documentation really 
yeah like your bills of materials you know those  

26
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,600
lists of every component you need KiBot generates 
those for you oh wow yeah it even gives you cost  

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,960
estimation so you're not like stuck trying to 
Wrangle a spreadsheet at two in the morning  

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,440
okay so it's like it's helping with the budget 
too that's actually amazing exactly it's super  

29
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,240
helpful whether you're you know just doing this as 
a hobby or you're running a whole business right  

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,640
that makes sense wow okay so far KiBot is blowing 
my mind a little bit wait there's more oh there's  

31
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,720
more yeah we haven't even gotten to one of the 
coolest Parts yet KiBot also does 3D modeling 3D  

32
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,280
modeling yeah like really high quality 3D models 
of your boards using blender okay now that I'm  

33
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,640
really interested in okay so before the break you 
kind of blew my mind a little bit talking about  

34
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,680
3D modeling I'm really curious about this yeah 
it's seriously cool stuff so tell me how does  

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,480
it actually work well KiBot basically takes your 
KiCad designs right and then it transforms them  

36
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,520
into these like really detailed 3D models okay 
so we're not talking about just like a basic 3D  

37
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,520
block here no no no not at all like it shows you 
the components the placements you know all the  

38
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,080
details even down to like the surface finishes 
it's pretty impressive wow that's amazing yeah  

39
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,000
what are the advantages of having you know 
like a Super high-quality 3D model like that  

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,640
well first off just visualizing the design you're 
not stuck with these like flat schematics anymore  

41
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,640
you can actually see how it all fits together in 
3D space right that makes a lot of sense yeah it  

42
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,160
makes it way easier to spot any potential issues 
like you know something's too close together or  

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,440
just to get a feel for the layout you know right 
especially with more complex boards that could be  

44
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,840
really helpful totally and it's not just for the 
designer either you can use these 3D models for  

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,240
presentations marketing materials stuff like that 
yeah definitely I mean everyone loves a good 3D  

46
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,280
render it's way more exciting than just looking at 
like a 2D drawing oh for sure and what's cool is  

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,360
because it uses blender which is like a really 
powerful 3D modeling software you're not just  

48
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,200
limited to viewing it you can actually export it 
in different formats and use it with other tools  

49
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,480
oh okay so you could take the model from KiBot and 
use it in a completely different program exactly  

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,600
so like give me an example how would you use that 
well let's say you're working with like mechanical  

51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,520
engineers and they're designing in the enclosure 
for your board you can export the KiBot model and  

52
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,160
send it to them and they can actually use it in 
their CAD software oh so they can make sure it  

53
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,760
fits properly and everything yep exactly no more 
back and forth trying to describe everything over  

54
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,080
email that's huge because those design clashes 
can be a real pain for sure or you know even  

55
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,080
if you just want to run some simulations like see 
how your board's going to perform under different  

56
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,760
conditions you can use those models for that too 
wow it's like you're giving your design a virtual  

57
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,040
test run before you even like s or anything 
exactly and this kind of 3D integration it's  

58
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,400
not something you see in a lot of free and open 
source tools it's really pretty remarkable what  

59
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,920
they're doing with KiBot it's very very cool okay 
so we talked about the 3D modeling but there's one  

60
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,520
more thing that I really wanted to ask you about 
and that's the product variance I've definitely  

61
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,280
worked on projects where like we needed a few 
different versions of the same board and it's  

62
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,560
always a bit of a headache to manage so before 
the break we were talking about product variants  

63
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,880
and I got to say for someone like me who hates 
juggling a million different files this sounds  

64
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,480
like a dream come true oh yeah it's a lifesaver so 
how does KiBot make it so easy to handle all these  

65
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,120
different variations so imagine this you have your 
base circuit board design right but you need a few  

66
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,560
different versions just with little tweaks here 
and there right like maybe one needs a different  

67
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,720
connector or you swapping out a wireless module 
or something exactly and instead of having to  

68
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:02,160
create like separate files for each version key 
lets you manage all those variations within the  

69
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,080
same project oh wow so it's all in one place 
yep you basically set up parameters right and  

70
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,280
different options for things so for your wireless 
module let's say it comes in Bluetooth Wi-Fi and  

71
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,120
cellular you tell KiBot hey this component could 
be any of these it's kind of like having a drop  

72
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,960
down menu right there in your design so you 
don't have to go back and like manually swap  

73
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,680
out components every time you need a different 
version yeah no when you're ready to generate  

74
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,600
your output files you just choose which variant 
you want KiBot does the rest that is so much  

75
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,120
slicker than the way I've been doing it and what 
about the documentation does it handle that for  

76
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,800
each variant too absolutely you get the correct 
boom assembly drawings everything for whichever  

77
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,680
variation you choose so no more second guessing if 
you're looking at the right files okay seriously  

78
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,160
that's amazing especially for like bigger projects 
that could save so much time and confusion  

79
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,800
it's like KiBot just brings order to the chaos 
exactly and this isn't just for like small tweaks  

80
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,160
talking you can even create completely different 
products from that same Core Design oh wow so you  

81
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,560
could have one base design that's like a platform 
for a whole product line exactly think of the  

82
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,360
designer use the the time and money you save key 
Bots really bringing these high-end features to  

83
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,840
everyone which is incredible it's amazing how 
much you could do with this one tool honestly  

84
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,640
we've covered so much automating all those tedious 
tasks creating amazing 3D models and now managing  

85
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,880
all these product variants KiBot sounds like it 
has everything covered yeah it's really remarkable  

86
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,960
what they've managed to put together the coolest 
part is it's open source right so it's constantly  

87
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,320
evolving always getting better exactly there's a 
whole community of developers constantly adding  

88
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,880
new features and making it even better that's 
what I love about open source so any predictions  

89
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:53,480
for the future of KiBot where do you see it going 
well it's hard to say for sure but I think it's  

90
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,040
part of this larger Trend you know these really 
powerful design tools they're becoming accessible  

91
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,040
to everyone so as it evolves I think KiBot has 
the potential to you know just make advanced  

92
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,760
electronics design something anyone can do not 
just big companies with big budgets that is such  

93
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,960
an exciting thought who knows what incredible 
inventions people will come up with when they  

94
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,960
have these kinds of tools at their fingertips 
well I have to say this deep dive into KiBot has  

95
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,520
been really eye-opening I think it's an amazing 
resource for anyone whether you're just getting  

96
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,600
started with electronics or you're a Season Pro I 
totally agree it's definitely worth checking out  

97
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,040
and for anyone listening who's feeling inspired 
you can find links to everything we talked about
