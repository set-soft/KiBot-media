1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,614
Okay, so today we're diving into this really cool tool I found.

2
00:00:03,742 --> 00:00:08,310
It's called KiBot, and it's designed to work with KiCad.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,174
I'm sure a lot of our listeners have heard of it, maybe even use it.

4
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:15,010
It's that free and open source electronics design software.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,406
Yeah, exactly.

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:22,078
So if anyone out there listening is tired of those tedious tasks, you know,

7
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:26,010
like all the boring stuff you have to do when you're designing electronic.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,380
Right? That's what KiBot is supposed to be, like, your new best friend.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,064
Okay, so walk me through it from the beginning.

10
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:41,900
What kinds of tasks does KiBot automate?

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,952
Okay. Kerber files.

12
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:50,340
Yeah, but for people who don't know, what are those?

13
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,306
So instead of me having to go and figure out all the settings every single

14
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:07,310
time, KiBot takes care of all that.

15
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,964
Oh, yeah, for sure.

16
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:21,524
Been there, done that.

17
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:22,564
Not fun.

18
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:25,716
So it's definitely saving us from some late night manufacturing panic

19
00:01:25,748 --> 00:01:29,108
attacks. Okay, so that's one less thing to worry about.

20
00:01:29,204 --> 00:01:33,980
But what about catching those errors before we even get to that stage? Like,

21
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,880
during the actual design process?

22
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,676
It's like having someone looking over your shoulder, double checking your

23
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:43,280
work.

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,744
That's a relief.

25
00:01:53,872 --> 00:01:56,780
Sometimes my brain just can't even handle another schematic.

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,272
Okay, so we've covered the manufacturing files and the error checking.

27
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:09,400
What else can this thing do? Documentation.

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,100
Really?

29
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,730
Oh, wow.

30
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,030
Okay, so it's like it's helping with the budget too.

31
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,290
That's actually amazing.

32
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,086
Right? That makes sense.

33
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:38,738
Wow. Okay, so far, KiBot is blowing my mind a little bit.

34
00:02:38,914 --> 00:02:40,230
Oh, there's more

35
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,510
3d modeling.

36
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,258
Okay, now that I'm really interested in.

37
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:55,146
Okay, so before the break, you kind of blew my mind a little bit.

38
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:57,990
Talking about 3d modeling, I'm really curious about this.

39
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,910
So tell me, how does it actually work?

40
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,430
Okay, so we're not talking about just like, a basic 3d block here.

41
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,850
Wow, that's amazing.

42
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,050
What are the advantages of having, you know, like, a super high quality 3d

43
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,230
model like that?

44
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,440
Right. That makes a lot of sense.

45
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,948
Right. Especially with more complex boards.

46
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:52,400
That could be really helpful.

47
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,774
Yeah, definitely.

48
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:02,790
I mean, everyone loves a good 3d render.

49
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,730
It's way more exciting than just looking at, like, a 2d drawing.

50
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,542
Oh, okay.

51
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:22,150
So you could take the model from KiBotan and use it in a completely

52
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,102
different program.

53
00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:24,614
So, like, give me an example.

54
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:25,810
How would you use that?

55
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,610
Oh, so they can make sure it fits properly and everything.

56
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,570
That's huge, because those design clashes can be a real pain.

57
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,070
Wow. It's like you're giving your design a virtual test run before you even

58
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,050
like solder anything.

59
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,782
It's very, very cool.

60
00:05:13,926 --> 00:05:17,716
Okay, so we talked about the 3d modeling, but there's one more thing that I

61
00:05:17,748 --> 00:05:20,868
really wanted to ask you about, and that's the product variants.

62
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:24,540
I've definitely worked on projects where, like, we needed a few different

63
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,084
versions of the same board, and it's always a bit of a headache to manage.

64
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:30,972
So before the break, we were talking about product variants, and I got to

65
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:35,604
say, for someone like me who hates juggling a million different files, this

66
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:37,240
sounds like a dream come true.

67
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,600
So how does KiBot make it so easy to handle all these different variations?

68
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,948
But you need a few different versions, just with little tweaks here and

69
00:05:48,964 --> 00:05:52,252
there, right? Like maybe one needs a different connector or are you swapping

70
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:54,040
out a wireless module or something?

71
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,364
Oh, wow.

72
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:05,320
So it's all in one place,

73
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,030
so you don't have to go back and like, manually swap out components every

74
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,730
time you need a different version.

75
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,566
That is so much slicker than the way I've been doing it.

76
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:39,370
And what about the documentation? Does it handle that for each variant too?

77
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,248
Okay, seriously, that's amazing.

78
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:52,392
Especially for like, bigger projects that could save so much time and

79
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:56,060
confusion. It's like KiBot just brings order to the chaos.

80
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,920
Oh, wow.

81
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,666
So you could have one base design that's like a platform for a whole product

82
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:09,350
line.

83
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,290
It's amazing how much you could do with this one tool.

84
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,322
Honestly, we've covered so much automating all those tedious tasks, creating

85
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:27,914
amazing 3d models, and now managing all these product variants.

86
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:30,230
Kibot sounds like it has everything covered.

87
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,764
The coolest part is it's open source.

88
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:38,680
Right? So it's constantly evolving, always getting better.

89
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,676
That's what I love about open source.

90
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:48,120
So, any predictions for the future of Kibot? Where do you see it going?

91
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,090
That is such an exciting thought.

92
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,126
Who knows what incredible inventions people will come up with when they have

93
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:18,294
these kinds of tools at their fingertips? Well, I have to say, this deep

94
00:08:18,342 --> 00:08:21,310
dive into KiBot has been really eye opening.

95
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,758
I think it's an amazing resource for anyone.

96
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:26,582
Whether you're just getting started with electronics or you're a seasoned

97
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,580
pro, you.
