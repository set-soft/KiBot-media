1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,592
KiBot.

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:06,330
Yeah,

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,022
yeah, it's getting pretty popular.

4
00:00:16,086 --> 00:00:17,490
A lot of people use it.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,528
Oh, tell me about it.

6
00:00:27,624 --> 00:00:28,980
So much clicking.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,376
Yeah, it can really be a game changer, especially if you're doing, like, any

8
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:37,580
kind of serious design work.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,352
Well, the main thing is it handles all those essential manufacturing files,

10
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:46,940
like Gerber files.

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,776
So Gerber files are basically like, think of them as blueprints, but for

12
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:58,382
your circuit board, you send those to the manufacturer, and that's what they

13
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:00,970
use to actually print the circuit board.

14
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,366
Exactly. It's a huge time saver.

15
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,278
And honestly, it just kind of takes away that possibility for human error.

16
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,358
Because we all know you stare at those circuit boards long enough, you're

17
00:01:17,374 --> 00:01:18,510
bound to mess something up.

18
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,130
Right.

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,820
For sure.

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,600
Right. And that's where those design rule checks come in.

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,260
The ERC and DRC.

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,272
Pretty much, it goes through and looks for common errors, any kind of

23
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:50,810
violations. And it really just makes sure your design is, you know, solid

24
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,910
and actually manufacturable.

25
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:00,990
Yeah, I feel that it's a lot, especially when you're in the zone for hours.

26
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,790
Well, it can do documentation, too.

27
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,754
Yeah, like your bills of materials.

28
00:02:11,802 --> 00:02:15,890
You know, those lists of every component you need? KiBot generates those

29
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,710
for you.

30
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,058
Yeah, it even gives you cost estimation.

31
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:22,242
So you're not, like, stuck trying to wrangle a spreadsheet at two in the

32
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:22,830
morning.

33
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,018
Exactly. It's super helpful, whether you're, you know, just doing this as a

34
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:31,910
hobby or you're running a whole business.

35
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,002
Wait, there's more? Yeah, we haven't even gotten to one of the coolest parts

36
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:44,590
yet. Ki bot also does 3d modeling.

37
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,670
Yeah. Like really high quality 3d models of your boards using blender.

38
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,430
Yeah, it's seriously cool stuff.

39
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,522
Well, KiBot basically takes your KCAD designs, right? And then it

40
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:10,550
transforms them into these, like, really detailed 3D Models.

41
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,422
No, no, no, not at all.

42
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:18,454
Like, it shows you the components, the placements, you know, all the

43
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:21,550
details, even down to, like, the surface finishes.

44
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,930
It's pretty impressive.

45
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,410
Yeah.

46
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,174
Well, first off, just visualizing the design.

47
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:35,526
You're not stuck with these, like, flat schematics anymore.

48
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,970
You can actually see how it all fits together in 3d space.

49
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,084
Yeah, it makes it way easier to spot any potential issues, like, you know,

50
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:48,612
something's too close together or just to get a feel for the layout, you

51
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:52,660
know? Totally.

52
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,420
And it's not just for the designer either.

53
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,156
You can use these 3d models for presentations, marketing materials, stuff

54
00:03:59,188 --> 00:03:59,960
like that.

55
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,270
Oh, for sure.

56
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,174
And what's cool is because it uses blender, which is like a really powerful

57
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:12,662
3d modeling software.

58
00:04:12,806 --> 00:04:15,726
You're not just limited to viewing it, you can actually export it in

59
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:18,330
different formats and use it with other tools.

60
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:29,262
Exactly. Well, let's say you're working with like, mechanical engineers and

61
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:31,238
they're designing the enclosure for your board.

62
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:34,958
You can export the KiBot model and send it to them, and they can actually

63
00:04:35,014 --> 00:04:36,770
use it in their CAD software.

64
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,170
Yep, exactly.

65
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,390
No more back and forth trying to describe everything over email

66
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,210
for sure.

67
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,866
Or, you know, even if you just want to run some simulations, like see how

68
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:55,026
your board is going to perform under different conditions, you can use those

69
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:56,270
models for that too.

70
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,372
Exactly. And this kind of 3d integration, it's not something you see in a

71
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:09,044
lot of free and open source tools.

72
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:27,860
It's really pretty remarkable what they're doing with KiBotan.

73
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,610
Oh, yeah, it's a lifesaver.

74
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,050
So imagine this, you have your base circuit board design, right?

75
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,600
Exactly. And instead of having to create like, separate files for each

76
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,344
version, KiBot lets you manage all those variations within the same

77
00:06:02,392 --> 00:06:05,600
project. Yep.

78
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,416
You basically set up parameters, right, and different options for things.

79
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:13,272
So for your wireless module, let's say it comes in Bluetooth, wifi and

80
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:16,880
cellular, you tell KiBot, hey, this component could be any of these.

81
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,100
It's kind of like having a dropdown menu right there in your design.

82
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,420
Yeah. New.

83
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,516
When you're ready to generate your output files, you just choose which

84
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:30,420
variant you want.

85
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,080
KiBot does the rest.

86
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,252
Absolutely. You get the correct boom, assembly drawings, everything for

87
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:44,804
whichever variation you choose.

88
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:48,040
So no more second guessing if you're looking at the right files.

89
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,314
Exactly. And this isn't just for, like, small tweaks we're talking.

90
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:04,074
You can even create completely different products from that same core

91
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:04,710
design.

92
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,242
Exactly. Think of the design, reuse, the time and money you save.

93
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:16,130
KiBot really bringing these high end features to everyone, which is

94
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:16,910
incredible.

95
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,490
Yeah, it's really remarkable what they've managed to put together.

96
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,502
Exactly. There's a whole community of developers constantly adding new

97
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,250
features and making it even better.

98
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:54,762
Well, it's hard to say for sure, but I think it's part of this larger trend.

99
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:58,226
You know, these really powerful design tools are becoming accessible to

100
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:03,250
everyone. So as it evolves, I think KiBot has the potential to, you know,

101
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,586
just make advanced electronics design, something anyone can do, not just big

102
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:08,190
companies with big budgets.

103
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,964
I totally agree.

104
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:29,300
It's definitely worth checking out.
