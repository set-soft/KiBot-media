1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,614
Okay, so today we're diving into this really cool tool I found.

2
00:00:03,742 --> 00:00:04,934
It's called KiBot.

3
00:00:04,982 --> 00:00:08,310
KiBot? Yeah, and it's designed to work with KiCad.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,174
I'm sure a lot of our listeners have heard of it, maybe even use it.

5
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:14,726
It's that free and open source electronics design software.

6
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:16,022
Yeah, it's getting pretty popular.

7
00:00:16,086 --> 00:00:17,206
A lot of people use it.

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:18,430
Yeah, exactly.

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,078
So if anyone out there listening is tired of those tedious tasks, you know,

10
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:25,750
like all the boring stuff you have to do when you're designing electronics.

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,518
Oh, tell me about it.

12
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:31,566
So much clicking right, that's what KiBot is supposed to be like, your new

13
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,078
best friend.

14
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:35,582
Yeah, it can really be a game changer, especially if you're doing any kind

15
00:00:35,606 --> 00:00:37,262
of serious design work.

16
00:00:37,326 --> 00:00:39,054
Okay, so walk me through it from the beginning.

17
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:43,078
What kinds of tasks does KiBot automate? Well, the main thing is it handles

18
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:45,342
all those essential manufacturing files.

19
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:46,886
Like Gerber files.

20
00:00:47,038 --> 00:00:47,966
Okay, Gerber files.

21
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:51,526
Yeah, but for people who don't know, what are those? So Gerber files are

22
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:56,382
basically like, think of them as blueprints, but for your circuit board, you

23
00:00:56,406 --> 00:01:00,006
send those to the manufacturer, and that's what they use to actually print

24
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:00,734
the circuit board.

25
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:05,326
So instead of me having to go and figure out all the settings every single

26
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:07,030
time, KiBot takes care of all that.

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,366
Exactly. It's a huge time saver.

28
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,302
And honestly, it just kind of takes away that possibility for human error.

29
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:17,342
Because we all know you stare at those circuit boards long enough, you're

30
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:19,974
bound to mess something up, right? Oh, yeah, for sure.

31
00:01:20,062 --> 00:01:21,540
Been there, done that.

32
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,568
Not fun.

33
00:01:22,704 --> 00:01:25,712
So it's definitely saving us from some late night manufacturing panic

34
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:26,860
attacks, for sure.

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,112
Okay, so that's one less thing to worry about.

36
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:33,960
But what about catching those errors before we even get to that stage? Like

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,872
during the actual design process? Right, and that's where those design rule

38
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:39,928
checks come in, the ERC and DRC.

39
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:42,672
It's like having someone looking over your shoulder, double checking your

40
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:43,696
work. Pretty much.

41
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:48,368
It goes through and looks for common errors, any kind of violations, and it

42
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:51,548
really just makes sure your design is, you know, solid and actually

43
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,764
manufacturable. That's a relief.

44
00:01:53,892 --> 00:01:56,524
Sometimes my brain just can't even handle another schematic.

45
00:01:56,612 --> 00:02:01,000
I feel that it's a lot, especially when you're in the zone for hours.

46
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,252
Okay, so we've covered the manufacturing files and the error checking.

47
00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:08,492
What else can this thing do? Well, it can do documentation, too.

48
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:11,764
Documentation, really? Yeah, like your bills of materials.

49
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:15,860
You know, those lists of every component you need? KiBot generates those

50
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,622
for you.

51
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:17,362
Oh, wow.

52
00:02:17,426 --> 00:02:20,802
Yeah. It even gives you cost estimation, so you're not stuck trying to

53
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:22,666
wrangle a spreadsheet at two in the morning.

54
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:25,050
Okay. So it's like it's helping with the budget too.

55
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:25,986
That's actually amazing.

56
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:30,602
Exactly. It's super helpful whether you're just doing this as a hobby or

57
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:31,770
you're running a whole business.

58
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,090
Right. That makes sense.

59
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,290
Wow. Okay, so far, kibot is blowing my mind a little bit.

60
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:38,986
Wait, there's more.

61
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,130
Oh, there's more? Yeah.

62
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,234
We haven't even gotten to one of the coolest parts yet.

63
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:44,330
Ki bot also does 3d modeling.

64
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,774
3d modeling? Yeah, like, really high quality 3d models of your boards using

65
00:02:48,822 --> 00:02:52,262
blender. Okay, now that I'm really interested in.

66
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:55,126
Okay, so before the break, you kind of blew my mind a little bit.

67
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:57,678
Talking about 3d modeling, I'm really curious about this.

68
00:02:57,734 --> 00:02:59,126
Yeah, it's seriously cool stuff.

69
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:03,438
So tell me, how does it actually work? Well, ki bot basically takes your

70
00:03:03,454 --> 00:03:08,398
KCAD designs, right? And then it transforms them into these, like, really

71
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:10,270
detailed 3d models.

72
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,262
Okay, so we're not talking about just like, a basic 3d block here.

73
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:15,438
No, no, no, not at all.

74
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:18,430
Like, it shows you the components, the placements, you know, all the

75
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,574
details, even down to, like, the surface finishes.

76
00:03:21,622 --> 00:03:22,646
It's pretty impressive.

77
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:23,702
Wow, that's amazing.

78
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:28,414
Yeah. What are the advantages of having, like, a super high quality 3d model

79
00:03:28,462 --> 00:03:31,174
like that? Well, first off, just visualizing the design.

80
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:35,526
You're not stuck with these, like, flat schematics anymore.

81
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,822
You can actually see how it all fits together in 3d space.

82
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:40,126
Right. That makes a lot of sense.

83
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:44,054
Yeah, it makes it way easier to spot any potential issues, like, you know,

84
00:03:44,102 --> 00:03:46,202
something's too close together or just.

85
00:03:46,246 --> 00:03:49,274
Just to get a feel for the layout, you know? Right.

86
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:52,154
Especially with more complex boards, that could be really helpful.

87
00:03:52,242 --> 00:03:54,426
Totally. And it's not just for the designer either.

88
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:59,146
You can use these 3d models for presentations, marketing materials, stuff

89
00:03:59,178 --> 00:03:59,762
like that.

90
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:00,754
Yeah, definitely.

91
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:02,810
I mean, everyone loves a good 3d render.

92
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,474
It's way more exciting than just looking at, like, a 2d drawing.

93
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:07,274
Oh, for sure.

94
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:11,170
And what's cool is because it uses blender, which is like a really powerful

95
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,674
3d modeling software.

96
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:14,386
You're not just limited to viewing it.

97
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:18,038
You can actually export it in different formats and use it with other tools.

98
00:04:18,114 --> 00:04:18,542
Oh, okay.

99
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:22,150
So you could take the model from KiBot and use it in a completely

100
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,822
different program.

101
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:24,614
Exactly. So, like, give me an example.

102
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:27,990
How would you use that? Well, let's say you're working with, like,

103
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,238
mechanical engineers and they're designing the enclosure for your board.

104
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:34,958
You can export the KiBot model and send it to them and they can actually

105
00:04:35,014 --> 00:04:36,782
use it in their cad software.

106
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:40,174
Oh, so they can make sure it fits properly and everything? Yep, exactly.

107
00:04:40,222 --> 00:04:43,230
No more back and forth trying to describe everything over email.

108
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,190
That's huge, because those design clashes can be a real pain for sure.

109
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,614
Or even if you just want to run some simulations, see how your board's going

110
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:55,686
to perform under different conditions, you can use those models for that

111
00:04:55,718 --> 00:04:59,742
too. Wow, it's like you're giving your design a virtual test run before you

112
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,846
even solder anything.

113
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:06,382
Exactly. And this kind of 3d integration, it's not something you see in a

114
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,054
lot of free and open source tools.

115
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:12,422
It's really pretty remarkable what they're doing with KiBot.

116
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:13,782
It's very, very cool.

117
00:05:13,926 --> 00:05:17,710
Okay, so we talked about the 3d modeling, but there's one more thing that I

118
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,854
really wanted to ask you about, and that's the product variants.

119
00:05:20,982 --> 00:05:24,534
I've definitely worked on projects where like, we needed a few different

120
00:05:24,582 --> 00:05:28,094
versions of the same board, and it's always a bit of a headache to manage.

121
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:31,486
So before the break we were talking about product variants, and I gotta say,

122
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:35,614
for someone like me who hates juggling a million different files, this

123
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:36,902
sounds like a dream come true.

124
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,368
Oh yeah, it's a lifesaver.

125
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:41,700
So how does KiBot make it so easy to handle all these different

126
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,900
variations? So imagine this, you have your base circuit board design, right?

127
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,948
But you need a few different versions, just with little tweaks here and

128
00:05:48,964 --> 00:05:52,252
there, right? Like maybe one needs a different connector or are you swapping

129
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:54,388
out a wireless module or something? Exactly.

130
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:59,732
And instead of having to create like separate files for each version, KiBot

131
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:02,812
lets you manage all those variations within the same project.

132
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,046
Oh wow, so it's all in one place.

133
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:08,926
Yep. You basically set up parameters, right, and different options for

134
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:13,086
things. So for your wireless module, let's say it comes in bluetooth, wifi

135
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:13,990
and cellular.

136
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,870
You tell KiBot, hey, this component could be any of these.

137
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,294
It's kind of like having a dropdown menu right there in your design so you

138
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:24,422
don't have to go back and like manually swap out components every time you

139
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:25,358
need a different version.

140
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:26,414
Yeah. New.

141
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:29,510
When you're ready to generate your output files, you just choose which

142
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,070
variant you want, KiBot does the rest.

143
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,586
That is so much slicker than the way I've been doing it.

144
00:06:35,738 --> 00:06:39,130
And what about the documentation, does it handle that for each variant too?

145
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,266
Absolutely. You get the correct boom, assembly drawings, everything for

146
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:44,794
whichever variation you choose.

147
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:47,866
So no more second guessing if you're looking at the right files.

148
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:49,218
Okay, seriously, that's amazing.

149
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:52,402
Especially for, like, bigger projects that could save so much time and

150
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:55,906
confusion. It's like KiBot just brings order to the chaos.

151
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:59,322
Exactly. And this isn't just for, like, small tweaks.

152
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:00,314
We're talking.

153
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:04,074
You can even create completely different products from that same core

154
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:04,930
design. Oh, wow.

155
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,666
So you could have one base design that's like a platform for a whole product

156
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:10,042
line. Exactly.

157
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:13,242
Think of the design, reuse the time and money you save.

158
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:16,106
KiBot really bringing these high end features to everyone, which is

159
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:19,842
incredible. It's amazing how much you could do with this one tool, honestly.

160
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:24,804
We've covered so much automating, all those tedious tasks, creating amazing

161
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:27,924
3d models, and now managing all these product variants.

162
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:30,172
Kibot sounds like it has everything covered.

163
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,284
Yeah, it's really remarkable what they've managed to put together.

164
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:35,764
The coolest part is it's open source.

165
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:38,380
Right. So it's constantly evolving, always getting better.

166
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,516
Exactly. There's a whole community of developers constantly adding new

167
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:42,980
features and making it even better.

168
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,676
That's what I love about open source.

169
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:48,080
So, any predictions for the future of Kibot? Where do you see it going?

170
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:54,752
Well, it's hard to say for sure, but I think it's part of this larger trend.

171
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:58,232
You know, these really powerful design tools are becoming accessible to

172
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:03,264
everyone. So as it evolves, I think KiBot has the potential to, you know,

173
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:06,600
just make advanced electronics design something anyone can do, not just big

174
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,944
companies with big budgets.

175
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:10,100
That is such an exciting thought.

176
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,112
Who knows what incredible inventions people will come up with when they have

177
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:18,284
these kinds of tools at their fingertips? Well, I have to say, this deep

178
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,300
dive into KiBot has been really eye opening.

179
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,748
I think it's an amazing resource for anyone.

180
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:26,596
Whether you're just getting started with electronics or you're a seasoned

181
00:08:26,628 --> 00:08:27,964
pro, I totally agree.

182
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:29,516
It's definitely worth checking out.
